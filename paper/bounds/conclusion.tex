We used row and column displacements to create a storage scheme that reduces the number of null entries that have to be stored for a not too sparse square table.
Using row displacement directories, the storage for the row displacements can be reduced even more.
By using the internal structure of the trie data structure, we finally get a storage scheme that is good for all tables.
